##  Overview

### 1. AND Gate Simulation

This project simulates the operation of a basic AND gate using Python. It demonstrates how a simple neural network can be trained to mimic the logic of an AND gate. The project covers:

- Implementing a simple perceptron.
- Training the perceptron to learn the AND logic.
- Evaluating the model’s performance.

### 2. California Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses the California Housing dataset to predict housing prices based on various features such as median income, house age, and more. A linear regression model is trained and evaluated using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.

### 3. Multi-Layer Perceptron

This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) using Python. The MLP is trained on a dataset to perform classification tasks. The project illustrates:

- Building a feedforward neural network.
- Training the network using backpropagation.
- Assessing the model’s accuracy and performance.

### 4. The Perceptron

This project focuses on the implementation of a single-layer perceptron for binary classification. It includes:

- Understanding the perceptron algorithm.
- Training the perceptron on a dataset.
- Visualizing the decision boundary and evaluating the model’s performance.
